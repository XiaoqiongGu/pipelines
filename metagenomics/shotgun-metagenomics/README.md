# shotgun-metagenomics


## Summary

This is basically a fork of Chenhao Li's
[shotgun-metagenomics-pipeline](https://github.com/CSB5/shotgun-metagenomics-pipeline),
which processes paired-end shotgun metagenomics data. Reads are
decontaminated against human after preprocessing. Then several
metagenomics frameworks are run (Kraken, HUMAnN2 and Metaphlan2) and
results combined where appropriate.


## Output

- FIXME
