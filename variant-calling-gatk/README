GATK haplotype calling using the workflow suggested in
https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/topic?name=methods#methods3893
Needs at least GATK 3.0, available in your PATH as "gatk".

GATK rules based on https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake-workflows/ commit fa47806

Changes:
- 'samples' (allowing multisample calling) is normally just one in our case. using multi_samples instead.
- _get_ref becomes: config["references"]["genome"]
- removed {reference} subdir
- known_variants change as in SG10K as part of references, i.e. hapmap, omni, g1k, dbsnp, mills
