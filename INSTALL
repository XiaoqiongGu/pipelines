# Setup Notes

**NOTE**: this setup is of limited use without auxiliary components
i.e. our specialized MongoDB setup used for logging and tracking


- Test scripts expect `RPD_ROOT` to be set
- ELM logging goes to `RPD_ELMLOGDIR`
- Create a snakemake environment
  - Install snakemake, drmaa and pymongo there
  - Change `lib/pipelines.py:write_snakemake_init` to point to this env
- Install pymongo into conda root env
- Create testing and logging directories per pipeline (see `tools/create_pipeline_dirs.sh`)
- Software/modules management is based on dotkit. See also `lib/pipelines.py:INIT`
