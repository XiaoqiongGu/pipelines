# - https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-cluster-configuration
# - time: changing depending on cluster and input data and used during submission so best set here
# - mem: needed for cluster submission so best set here
# - missing threads

# ""cluster config is not really suited for specifying the threads used in a job.""
# accessible using {threads} anyway and set to 1 by default
