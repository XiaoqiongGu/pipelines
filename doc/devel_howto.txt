- each pipeline should have its equally named subfolder containing an equally named wrapper script
- 'master' should always be deployable i.e. always pass all tests
- development work should happen on the 'devel' branch of even better a topic branch thereof and only be merged into testing once all tests pass
- for each newly created script or functionality add a dryrun and a real test to the corresponding tests.sh
  - dryrun means the test can be run immediately without submission
  - a real run would be submitted and run on real data
- test input data should be placed in testing/data/<pipeline>
- testing output should be written to  testing/output/<pipeline>
